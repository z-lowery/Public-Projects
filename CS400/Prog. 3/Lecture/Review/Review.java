/*
 * Client:
	The client is the entity that sends a request to the server, typically a browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) or a program (e.g., curl or a custom application).
	Example: When you type http://localhost/?2017 into your browser and hit Enter, your browser is acting as the client.

* Server:
	The server is the program (your Java HttpServer) that listens for incoming requests from clients, processes them, and sends back a response.
	Example: Your Java program receives the clientâ€™s request for ?2017, processes it, and sends back the HTML page with the song list.

	The client initiates requests; the server processes them and responds.
